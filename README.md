# Real-Estate-House-Price-Predictor
This repository includes an open source project which combines Data Science, Microservices and Artificial Intelligence. The aim of this project is to demonstrate data science outcomes inside a chatbot. We analyze a real estate property dataset and construct a model. Then we predict the approximate prices of new properties. We display them via chatbot.
